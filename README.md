# songcrud1 

### Create a new [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project named `SONGCRUD` and create an app in the project called “MUSICAPP”. Your project must contain a requirements.txt file housing all the pinned dependencies from your project. Push the project to GitHub and submit your public GitHub repository link.

### We would be building a simple song CRUD application. In our models.py file inside the “musicapp” application we created, you are expected to add the following Models and Attributes. 
### Model: Artiste, Song, Lyric
### Attributes for “Artiste” : first_name, last_name, age Attributes for “Song” : title, date released, likes, artiste_id Attributes for “Lyric”: content, song_id
### As you might have guessed, there is a relationship between all three Models. An Artiste can have multiple songs, and a song can have multiple lyrics.A song must only belong to one Artiste and a lyric must only belong to a song. You are to specify the foreignkey relationship yourself. Also, the model field attributes should be specified by you. 
### Push the task to GitHub when you finish and submit the GitHub repository link
